# 4 channel BLE time delay relay

My mom's hobby is growing plants. The device is designed for growing plants in winter and spring, when there is little sunlight in Moscow. 

This is a 4-channel BLE time delay relay based on the Nordic nRF51.
The device has 4 channels. Each channel controls its own group of specific red and blue LEDs. 

IDE: Keil uVision
